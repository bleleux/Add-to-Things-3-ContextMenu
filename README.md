# Add-to-Things-3-ContextMenu

Right-click menu option for adding pages and selected text from a Chromium browser to [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) on MacOS.

Same function and formatting as the standard browser extension from [Bram Schulting](https://github.com/bramschulting/add-to-things) and [Kristoffer](https://github.com/kristofferR/add-to-things-3), but moved to the right click menu. 

Made for manifest version 3. Manifest v3 of the browser extension is [in my repo](https://github.com/bleleux/add-to-things-3) if you want a pinned shortcut instead.

Right clicking anywhere on a page will show an "Add to Things" option that opens the Things 3 quick entry window. It will assign the active page's title as the task's title and the URL to the notes. If you had text selected when clicking "Add to Things," it will include it in the notes on a new line.
